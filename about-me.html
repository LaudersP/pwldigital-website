                <h2>Academics</h2>
                <p>
                    My dedication to academic excellence has earned me Dean's List honors for Spring 2023, reflecting my commitment to excellence that extends beyond the classroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most exciting aspects in my academic journey is my role as the lead student researcher in a university-funded project.
                     Our ambitious mission is to create an AI-powered swim instructor assistant, capable of providing swimmers with comprehensive performance analytics and actionable insights.
                      In addition to acquiring necessities such as the Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit, I have been heavily involved in the design and build of the entire system.
                       Our goal is to achieve this technological milestone by December 2024, and each day brings us one step closer to achieving this vision of ours.
                        This hands-on experience allows me to explore the evolution of AI technology and its transformative capabilities in the real world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to research, I proudly work as a supplemental instructor (SI) for electronics core courses (Digital Fundamentals (DC), Digital Fundamentals (AC), and Electronics).
                     I actively help enhance the learning experience for my tutees, whether it's guiding them through labs, giving engaging lectures,
                      or providing individual tutoring during time outside of the classroom.
                       Seeing tutees grow academically is a source of great pride and inspiration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not involved in the technical world, you can find me on the men's bowling team, where I embrace teamwork, discipline and competitive passion.
                </p>
