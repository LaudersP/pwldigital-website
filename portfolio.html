                <h3>September 23, 2023 - October 13, 2023</h3>
                <p>This project centered around the HTML language, allowed me to learn the coding language. 
                    It also allowed for me to create this website which acts as my digital footprint to the world, along with allowing me to publish my work to the internet.
                </p>
                <h3>From this project, I was able to:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Design and develop a dynamic website</li>
                    <li>Implement a user-friendly interface for easy navigation</li>

                <h3>May 6, 2023 - October 1, 2023</h3>
                <p>This project which focused on taking a child's PowerWheels vehicle and converting it to be self-driven,
                    was a step into learning about A.I. and understanding how companies such as Tesla blend the barrier between the automobile industry and computer science. 
                </p>
                <h3>From this project, I have learned:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The true importance of datasheets and specification sheets</li>
                    <li>A better understanding of circuits and PCB design</li>
                    <li>A.I. model types, and training</li>
                    <li>Higher level prototyping</li>
                    <li>An introduction to TensorFlow</li>
                    <li>An introduction to data preprocessing/augmentation</li>

                <p>
                    This project focused around A.I. allows for the connection between computer science and the game of swimming.
                    This project holds the potential to revolutionize the way swimmers train and improve their performance.
                </p>
                <h3>During this project I have:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducted research of parts to support project objectives</li>
                    <li>Manage project expenses closely to ensure adherence to the allocated budget</li>
                    <li>Led development to ensure progress was made and to meet deadlines</li>
                    <li>Research leading-edge A.I. technologies to ensure the reliability of the A.I.</li>
                    <li>Continue development to ensure the project developments are on course with the project objectives</li>

                <p>
                    With this project I plan to design and develop a professional version of a older high school project.
                     This project will combine the world of advanced bowlers with the world of computer science!
                </p>
                <h3>Pre-brainstorming Objectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Design and manufacture my own microcontroller motherboard</li>
                    <li>Interface wireless connection to a mobile device</li>
                    <li>Provide the end-user with an easy to use device</li>
                    <li>Innovate on pre-existing products on the market</li>

                <h2>Jetson Nano Powered Power Wheels Version 2.0</h2>
                <p>In the second verison of this project, I wish to build upon the foundation created in version 1.0.</p>
                <p>
                    The first of many changes will be the way the A.I. interprets curves, along with a broader dataset used to train the A.I. model.
                    Along with this the auto-braking sensor will be upgraded to allow for a more advanced braking feature with braking  prediction.
                </p>
